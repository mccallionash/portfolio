    <p> Barter Mates began as a user-centered design group project during the first semester of my masters. The group stage invloved the inital research and design process, prototyping and user-evaluation. The group project resulted in a vertical-paper prototype of three user tasks to be carried out on an application alongside a lo-fi prototype of a modular locker. Following the user-testing evaluation, we individually iterated our primatry prototype. Overall, I was happy with the result of our evaluation testing. I feel like I have learned a lot in terms of carrying out the task, the preparation involved and have gained experience in carrying out testing as a group. Iâ€™ve gained insight into the roles involved and how to work with users to create a comfortable and collaborative experience. We steadily progressed in confidence over the series of evaluations. </p>
        
    <p>Having a strong background in hands-on fabrication, I used the individual iteration time to learn new digital making skills with Figma. The concept behind these prototypes focused on creating a design intervention to alleviate  the financial stresses of student living by facilitating a bartering(swapping) local economy with a community building ethos. I used Figma to create my prototype iteration of the bartering task, this was the most difficult flow for our users. As the task was included in our original prototype, this iteration has increased fidelity. This was a learning curve for me as I had not used the software before. I created an account and followed some basic tutorials, including one on wire-framing entitled Prototyping in Figma. I found the software to be intuitive from my understanding of Adobe Illustrator. I used my storyboarding interaction to develop the prototype, referencing the user feedback and including a review feature post barter transaction. I also included a profile status for locker or in-person bartering as per user feedback. I used vector drawn images of items on the app collected from royalty-free sites instead of photographic images to keep a low-fidelity feel to the iteration. My secondary research into the history and procedure of bartering informed increased functions for bartering using a messenger/chat feature (included in first iteration).</p>
        
    <p>I have found over the course of this project I have gotten quite attached to Barter Mates as a design idea. In an ideal world, I would like to complete a user task analysis of this iteration, continuing with a co-evaluation method but with increased usability testing to enable further iteration of the application.</p>
