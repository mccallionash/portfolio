    <p>Given the theme of <i>Life</i> for a photography project during the first semester of my master's programme, I explored the idea that we cannot capture reality exactly as it exisits. I wanted to play with my notion of reality and create a mythology inspired series of images. To interpret this theme technically, I captured dark, moody, transient images with subjects that have pre-exisiting notions of meaning as they relate to myth and folklore. I challenged myself to take photos in a night setting to improve my knowledge of the camera. To keep a sense of the uncanny throughout the series I intentionally captured dark, tonal backgrounds and used contrasting highlighting to empahise the subject matter, letting it become the focal point of each frame. This was an enjoyable project that let me explore narrative through photography. This notion was interogratted further by using compostion to ascribe further meaning to the images and create a playful dyanmic for the eye to wander within the frame. In editing I was able to create and document a post-production workflow, aiding me in future photography projects.</p>

          <p>To accompany my photo series I created a prose short story. I used the text to craft an audio soundscape. To record my own audio I used a zoom H4n. I used the integrated mics and a combination of 90 and 120 degree audio capture, settling on 120 for more ambient sounds. I really enjoyed the process with the zoom, but I would like to explore the addition of external mics in future. I used a combination of online resources for additional audio including samples from purple planet and zapsplat. Stitching together the soundscape was a matter of back and forth with the text, listening and reading to convey the experience, tempo and mood of the story through sound. My process was built alongside trying to build the narrative. I began with all the tracks open and trying to edit them on the fly but this was incredibly frustrating. I decided to have channels that were defined by atmosphere and action, or background and foreground sounds. I edited each of the sounds I gathered, for my own recording I used the effect of normalising to decrease the decibal level to better match with my sourced sounds. I used the evenlope tool to further place atmospheric sounds in the background of the piece. I found the time shift tool incredibly useful for editing the tempo of the piece as I refered back to text for speed. This project opened my eyes to possibilties of connecting audio, imagery and prose to extend the potential interaction of an audience with one concept. </p>
