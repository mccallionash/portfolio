    <p>Baye is a brand development project for Donegal Bay Ltd and Blarney Woollen Mills. During this employment I was lead designer, lead technician, brand designer and art director. This was an exciting project that let me explore a broad range of skills, taking a brand from a concept to an exisiting and selling fashion label. My aim was to explore the concept of affordable luxury, best practice in conscious knitwear design and placing fashion technology at the forefront of the design process. My brief was to create a new Irish fashion knitwear brand for a eco-conscious domestic market with potential to pitch to the factory's exisiting international sales teams. Working together with the team in the factory while liasioning the CEO in Blarney, I worked to develop brand concept, visual identity, logo, website, lineups, yarn colours & fibres, product development and programming samples for production. Baye is Irish, design-led knitwear that embodies a new aesthetic whilst respecting sustainability and heritage. Using certified organic, natural and recycled fibres, sourced from sustainable mills that share the brand's ethos of supply chain transparency. My goal was to employ conscious decision making and lean design practices to streamline production and simplify garment construction resulting in minimal resource waste. From the first stitch to the final press, each garment is still made to order by an exceptional team of experienced artisans. Each garment was developed with the positive intent to create relaxed, sophisticated everyday-wear full of character and creativity. A 12 month project which ended with Baye being represented by 6 international sales agents and selling directly on the Blarney Woollen Mills website.</p>
