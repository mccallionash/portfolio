    <p>It Just So Happens is an interactive art piece created as part of CS6351 Physical Computing module during my masters degreee. The project is part of a group exhibition entitled We’re Stealing Bread, Nothing Else, a line taken from The Second Bakery Attack by Haruki Murakami. In this story, Murakami layers the personal with the political in tackling an existentialist view of modern-day life under capitalist control in contrast to the familial, traditional society of old. A response to this text underlies the curatorial concept of the exhibition. The technical aspect of this project demonstrates the learning outcomes achieved in the areas of Arduino, Max 8 and the C programming language. The project developed to include digital illustration and CAD making using the laser cutter.  </p>
        
    <p>It Just So Happens interrogates the differing interpretations of agency manifest in the text through the husband and wife’s personal relationship to fate. A display box laser-cut from plywood with doors controlled by servo motors open a window of opportunity, offering the viewer a chance to decide to engage, or not mirroring this conflict. The doors are connected to a separate motion sensor via Wi-Fi which appears as an unconnected piece, thus bringing about the idea that ‘Things happen. Or not’. The doors of this window of opportunity contain the lines spoken by the wife during the robbery ‘Thirty Big Macs. For Take Out’ which inspired a digital illustration print series of thirty Big Macs, fabricating an opportunistic situation for the viewer to steal from the exhibition itself, or not of course. It Just So Happens is created with the C programming language to control a MKR 1000 Wi-Fi Arduino, an electronic circuit and a Max 8 patch created to detect motion using an iMac web camera. The project includes a connection to a MQTT broker, enabling separate display locations for the motion detector and the physical piece.</p>
        
    <p>An existentialist reading of text lead to the exploration of agency in the piece It Just So Happens. Incorporating IoT logic into the piece felt necessary to establish the opportunistic interaction referring to Murakami’s synopsis that ‘we never choose anything at all. Things happen. Or not’. There is potential to expand this learning and create a more developed use of this logic, perhaps creating multiple pieces talking to each other or through collaboration develop an exhibition of complete interactivity. The process of combining electronics, coding and Murakami wasn’t anything I had foresaw when deciding to take Physical Computing as a module. Coming from a background in knitwear and textile design, I wanted to experience the physicality and material world of computer technology that feels intangible to an outsider or general ‘user’. A designer in any other field concentrates on being able to master their materials so beginning to understand the new materials of the ICT field and their characteristics is important to me. As difficult as I found the learning curve for this project, it has been incredibly rewarding in growing my understanding.</p>
